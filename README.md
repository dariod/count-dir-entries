This script was developed to help researching the behavior of a certain class users in order to better define a design problem. We needed to know how many files per directory the users deal with.

An example run:
```text
$ python ./countEntries.py ~
Walked through 155563 directories
Mean number of entries per directory: 5.248497
Maximum number of entries in a directory: 35622 (/Users/dario/Library/Caches/Metadata/Safari/History)
