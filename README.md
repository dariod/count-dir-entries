This script was delevoped to help researching the behavior of a certain class of users in order to better define a design problem.
We needed to know how many files per directory the users deal with.

An example run:
```text
$ python ./countEntries.py ~
Walked through 155486 directories
Mean number of entries per directory: 5.245553
Maximum number of entries in a directory: 35609
```
